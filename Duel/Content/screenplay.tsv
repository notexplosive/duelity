say	Sar	Howdy, Sir! Welcome to Thistown. I'm Sar Saparilla, the resident.
say	SheriffNormal	.....
say	Sar	What can I do for you on this fine day? You lookin' to stay, or just passing through?
say	SheriffNormal	..... Just passing through.
say	Sar	Good to hear! After all, Thistown ain't big enough for the both of us.
say	Sar	... on account of the city limits being about 8 square feet!
say	SheriffNormal	I'm looking for the deadliest gunslinger around.
say	Sar	Best gunslinger? That'd be RED DEATH KILLER.
say	Sar	I hear he's been hanging out in the city of Tarnation.
say	SheriffSpooked	What?!? In Tarnation??
say	Sar	Afraid so. I know it's a long way, but there's a trail up north that'll put you on the right track.
say	SheriffDeepBow	..... Fair enough. Thank you, sir.

say	RenegadeEw	I'm looking for a DUEL. Any leads?
say	Sar	Well, a mysterious Sheriff just passed through here not too long ago.
say	Sar	He was looking for RED DEATH KILLER. Sounds like a DUEL in the making to me.
say	RenegadeSmirk	RED DEATH KILLER, eh? Sounds promising.
say	Sar	They're bound to meet up in Tarnation. Just head north and you'll get there for sure.
say	RenegadeLaugh	Just head north? I can handle that.
